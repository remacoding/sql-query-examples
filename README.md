# SQL Query Examples On Heart Disease Dataset

This repository contains the comprehensive Heart Disease Dataset, created by combining five popular heart disease datasets. This combined dataset is the largest of its kind and is designed to advance research in coronary artery disease (CAD) through machine learning and data mining techniques, potentially improving clinical diagnosis and early treatment.

## Dataset Overview

The Heart Disease Dataset includes data from the following five sources:

1. **Cleveland**
2. **Hungarian**
3. **Switzerland**
4. **Long Beach VA**
5. **Statlog (Heart) Data Set**

### Features

The combined dataset consists of **1190 instances** and **12 common features**. These features are essential for building predictive models and conducting data analysis for heart disease research.

### Size

- **File Size:** 408 kB
- **Instances:** 1190
- **Features:** 12

## Features

- **Age:** Age of the patient
- **Sex:** Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
- **Chest Pain Type (cp):** Type of chest pain experienced by the patient (0-3)
- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps):** Resting blood pressure in mm Hg
- **Serum Cholesterol (chol):** Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs):** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg):** Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach):** Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exercise Induced Angina (exang):** Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak):** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope):** Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
- **Class (target column):** Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = heart disease; 0 = normal)

## Description of Nominal Attributes

- **Sex:**
  - 1 = male
  - 0 = female

- **Chest Pain Type:**
  - Value 1: typical angina
  - Value 2: atypical angina
  - Value 3: non-anginal pain
  - Value 4: asymptomatic

- **Fasting Blood Sugar:**
  - Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

- **Resting Electrocardiogram Results:**
  - Value 0: normal
  - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
  - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

- **Exercise Induced Angina:**
  - 1 = yes
  - 0 = no

- **The Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment:**
  - Value 1: upsloping
  - Value 2: flat
  - Value 3: downsloping

- **Class (target column):**
  - 1 = heart disease
  - 0 = normal
